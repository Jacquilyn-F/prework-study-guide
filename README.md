# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This project is created to help the user understand the basic coding procedures in realtion to HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. By building this project I was able to understand the meticulous work that will come when working with front-end coding. Every key stroke matters! By having this study guide not only can it be used for its webpage design and quick information, but also the ins and outs of how the project was created can be studied for furture challenges that this bootcammp will soon provide. What I have learned most from this project is taking your time and reviewing all syntax is crucial when creating any and all code.


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

The Prework Study guide contains notes about topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
 And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
